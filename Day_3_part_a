⚙️ Section 1: Setup
1.1: Install dependencies
The Kaggle Notebooks environment includes a pre-installed version of the google-adk library for Python and its required dependencies, so you don't need to install additional packages in this notebook.

To install and use ADK in your own Python development environment outside of this course, you can do so by running:

pip install google-adk
1.2: Configure your Gemini API Key
This notebook uses the Gemini API, which requires authentication.

1. Get your API key

If you don't have one already, create an API key in Google AI Studio.

2. Add the key to Kaggle Secrets

Next, you will need to add your API key to your Kaggle Notebook as a Kaggle User Secret.

In the top menu bar of the notebook editor, select Add-ons then Secrets.
Create a new secret with the label GOOGLE_API_KEY.
Paste your API key into the "Value" field and click "Save".
Ensure that the checkbox next to GOOGLE_API_KEY is selected so that the secret is attached to the notebook.
3. Authenticate in the notebook

Run the cell below to complete authentication.

import os
from kaggle_secrets import UserSecretsClient

try:
    GOOGLE_API_KEY = UserSecretsClient().get_secret("GOOGLE_API_KEY")
    os.environ["GOOGLE_API_KEY"] = GOOGLE_API_KEY
    print("✅ Gemini API key setup complete.")
except Exception as e:
    print(
        f"🔑 Authentication Error: Please make sure you have added 'GOOGLE_API_KEY' to your Kaggle secrets. Details: {e}"
    )
✅ Gemini API key setup complete.
1.3: Import ADK components
Now, import the specific components you'll need from the Agent Development Kit and the Generative AI library. This keeps your code organized and ensures we have access to the necessary building blocks.

from typing import Any, Dict

from google.adk.agents import Agent, LlmAgent
from google.adk.apps.app import App, EventsCompactionConfig
from google.adk.models.google_llm import Gemini
from google.adk.sessions import DatabaseSessionService
from google.adk.sessions import InMemorySessionService
from google.adk.runners import Runner
from google.adk.tools.tool_context import ToolContext
from google.genai import types

print("✅ ADK components imported successfully.")
✅ ADK components imported successfully.
1.4: Helper functions
Helper function that manages a complete conversation session, handling session creation/retrieval, query processing, and response streaming. It supports both single queries and multiple queries in sequence.

Example:

>>> await run_session(runner, "What is the capital of France?", "geography-session")
>>> await run_session(runner, ["Hello!", "What's my name?"], "user-intro-session")
# Define helper functions that will be reused throughout the notebook
async def run_session(
    runner_instance: Runner,
    user_queries: list[str] | str = None,
    session_name: str = "default",
):
    print(f"\n ### Session: {session_name}")

    # Get app name from the Runner
    app_name = runner_instance.app_name

    # Attempt to create a new session or retrieve an existing one
    try:
        session = await session_service.create_session(
            app_name=app_name, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=session_name
        )
    except:
        session = await session_service.get_session(
            app_name=app_name, user_id=USER_ID, session_id=session_name
        )

    # Process queries if provided
    if user_queries:
        # Convert single query to list for uniform processing
        if type(user_queries) == str:
            user_queries = [user_queries]

        # Process each query in the list sequentially
        for query in user_queries:
            print(f"\nUser > {query}")

            # Convert the query string to the ADK Content format
            query = types.Content(role="user", parts=[types.Part(text=query)])

            # Stream the agent's response asynchronously
            async for event in runner_instance.run_async(
                user_id=USER_ID, session_id=session.id, new_message=query
            ):
                # Check if the event contains valid content
                if event.content and event.content.parts:
                    # Filter out empty or "None" responses before printing
                    if (
                        event.content.parts[0].text != "None"
                        and event.content.parts[0].text
                    ):
                        print(f"{MODEL_NAME} > ", event.content.parts[0].text)
    else:
        print("No queries!")


print("✅ Helper functions defined.")
✅ Helper functions defined.
1.5: Configure Retry Options
When working with LLMs, you may encounter transient errors like rate limits or temporary service unavailability. Retry options automatically handle these failures by retrying the request with exponential backoff.

retry_config = types.HttpRetryOptions(
    attempts=5,  # Maximum retry attempts
    exp_base=7,  # Delay multiplier
    initial_delay=1,
    http_status_codes=[429, 500, 503, 504],  # Retry on these HTTP errors
)
🤹 Section 2: Session Management
2.1 The Problem
At their core, Large Language Models are inherently stateless. Their awareness is confined to the information you provide in a single API call. This means an agent without proper context management will react to the current prompt without considering any previous history.

❓ Why does this matter? Imagine trying to have a meaningful conversation with someone who forgets everything you've said after each sentence. That's the challenge we face with raw LLMs!

In ADK, we use Sessions for short term memory management and Memory for long term memory. In the next notebook, you'll focus on Memory.

2.2 What is a Session?
📦 Session
A session is a container for conversations. It encapsulates the conversation history in a chronological manner and also records all tool interactions and responses for a single, continuous conversation. A session is tied to a user and agent; it is not shared with other users. Similarly, a session history for an Agent is not shared with other Agents.

In ADK, a Session is comprised of two key components Events and State:

📝 Session.Events:

While a session is a container for conversations, Events are the building blocks of a conversation.

Example of Events:

User Input: A message from the user (text, audio, image, etc.)
Agent Response: The agent's reply to the user
Tool Call: The agent's decision to use an external tool or API
Tool Output: The data returned from a tool call, which the agent uses to continue its reasoning
{} Session.State:

session.state is the Agent's scratchpad, where it stores and updates dynamic details needed during the conversation. Think of it as a global {key, value} pair storage which is available to all subagents and tools.

Session state and events

2.3 How to manage sessions?
An agentic application can have multiple users and each user may have multiple sessions with the application. To manage these sessions and events, ADK offers a Session Manager and Runner.

SessionService: The storage layer

Manages creation, storage, and retrieval of session data
Different implementations for different needs (memory, database, cloud)
Runner: The orchestration layer

Manages the flow of information between user and agent
Automatically maintains conversation history
Handles the Context Engineering behind the scenes
Think of it like this:

Session = A notebook 📓
Events = Individual entries in a single page 📝
SessionService = The filing cabinet storing notebooks 🗄️
Runner = The assistant managing the conversation 🤖
2.4 Implementing Our First Stateful Agent
Let's build our first stateful agent, that can remember and have constructive conversations.

ADK offers different types of sessions suitable for different needs. As a start, we'll start with a simple Session Management option (InMemorySessionService):

APP_NAME = "default"  # Application
USER_ID = "default"  # User
SESSION = "default"  # Session

MODEL_NAME = "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"


# Step 1: Create the LLM Agent
root_agent = Agent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite", retry_options=retry_config),
    name="text_chat_bot",
    description="A text chatbot",  # Description of the agent's purpose
)

# Step 2: Set up Session Management
# InMemorySessionService stores conversations in RAM (temporary)
session_service = InMemorySessionService()

# Step 3: Create the Runner
runner = Runner(agent=root_agent, app_name=APP_NAME, session_service=session_service)

print("✅ Stateful agent initialized!")
print(f"   - Application: {APP_NAME}")
print(f"   - User: {USER_ID}")
print(f"   - Using: {session_service.__class__.__name__}")
✅ Stateful agent initialized!
   - Application: default
   - User: default
   - Using: InMemorySessionService
2.5 Testing Our Stateful Agent
Now let's see the magic of sessions in action!

# Run a conversation with two queries in the same session
# Notice: Both queries are part of the SAME session, so context is maintained
await run_session(
    runner,
    [
        "Hi, I am Sam! What is the capital of United States?",
        "Hello! What is my name?",  # This time, the agent should remember!
    ],
    "stateful-agentic-session",
)
 ### Session: stateful-agentic-session

User > Hi, I am Sam! What is the capital of United States?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Hi Sam! The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C.

User > Hello! What is my name?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Your name is Sam.
🎉 Success! The agent remembered your name because both queries were part of the same session. The Runner automatically maintained the conversation history.

But there's a catch: InMemorySessionService is temporary. Once the application stops, all conversation history is lost.

🛑 (Optional) 2.6 Testing Agent's forgetfulness
To verify that the agent forgets the conversation, restart the kernel. Then, run ALL the previous cells in this notebook EXCEPT the run_session in 2.5.

Now run the cell below. You'll see that the agent doesn't remember anything from the previous conversation.

# Run this cell after restarting the kernel. All this history will be gone...
await run_session(
    runner,
    ["What did I ask you about earlier?", "And remind me, what's my name?"],
    "stateful-agentic-session",
)  # Note, we are using same session name
 ### Session: stateful-agentic-session

User > What did I ask you about earlier?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You asked me what the capital of the United States is.

User > And remind me, what's my name?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Your name is Sam.
The Problem
Session information is not persistent (i.e., meaningful conversations are lost). While this is advantageous in testing environments, in the real world, a user should be able to refer from past and resume conversations. To achieve this, we must persist information.

📈 Section 3: Persistent Sessions with DatabaseSessionService
While InMemorySessionService is great for prototyping, real-world applications need conversations to survive restarts, crashes, and deployments. Let's level up to persistent storage!

3.1 Choosing the Right SessionService
ADK provides different SessionService implementations for different needs:

Service	Use Case	Persistence	Best For
InMemorySessionService	Development & Testing	❌ Lost on restart	Quick prototypes
DatabaseSessionService	Self-managed apps	✅ Survives restarts	Small to medium apps
Agent Engine Sessions	Production on GCP	✅ Fully managed	Enterprise scale
3.2 Implementing Persistent Sessions
Let's upgrade to DatabaseSessionService using SQLite. This gives us persistence without needing a separate database server for this demo.

Let's create a chatbot_agent capable of having a conversation with the user.

# Step 1: Create the same agent (notice we use LlmAgent this time)
chatbot_agent = LlmAgent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite", retry_options=retry_config),
    name="text_chat_bot",
    description="A text chatbot with persistent memory",
)

# Step 2: Switch to DatabaseSessionService
# SQLite database will be created automatically
db_url = "sqlite:///my_agent_data.db"  # Local SQLite file
session_service = DatabaseSessionService(db_url=db_url)

# Step 3: Create a new runner with persistent storage
runner = Runner(agent=chatbot_agent, app_name=APP_NAME, session_service=session_service)

print("✅ Upgraded to persistent sessions!")
print(f"   - Database: my_agent_data.db")
print(f"   - Sessions will survive restarts!")
✅ Upgraded to persistent sessions!
   - Database: my_agent_data.db
   - Sessions will survive restarts!
3.3 Test Run 1: Verifying Persistence
In this first test run, we'll start a new conversation with the session ID test-db-session-01. We will first introduce our name as 'Sam' and then ask a question. In the second turn, we will ask the agent for our name.

Since we are using DatabaseSessionService, the agent should remember the name.

After the conversation, we'll inspect the my_agent_data.db SQLite database directly to see how the conversation events (the user queries and model responses) are stored.

await run_session(
    runner,
    ["Hi, I am Sam! What is the capital of the United States?", "Hello! What is my name?"],
    "test-db-session-01",
)
 ### Session: test-db-session-01

User > Hi, I am Sam! What is the capital of the United States?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Hi Sam! The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C.

User > Hello! What is my name?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Your name is Sam.
🛑 (Optional) 3.4 Test Run 2: Resuming a Conversation
‼️ Now, let's repeat the test again, but this time, let's stop this Kaggle Notebook's kernel and restart it again.

Run all the previous cells in the notebook, EXCEPT the previous Section 3.3 (run_session cell).

Now, run the below cell with the same session ID (test-db-session-01).

We will ask a new question and then ask for our name again. Because the session is loaded from the database, the agent should still remember that our name is 'Sam' from the first test run. This demonstrates the power of persistent sessions.

await run_session(
    runner,
    ["What is the capital of India?", "Hello! What is my name?"],
    "test-db-session-01",
)
 ### Session: test-db-session-01

User > What is the capital of India?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  The capital of India is New Delhi.

User > Hello! What is my name?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Your name is Sam.
3.5 Let's verify that the session data is isolated
As mentioned earlier, a session is private conversation between an Agent and a User (i.e., two sessions do not share information). Let's run our run_session with a different session name test-db-session-02 to confirm this.

await run_session(
    runner, ["Hello! What is my name?"], "test-db-session-02"
)  # Note, we are using new session name
 ### Session: test-db-session-02

User > Hello! What is my name?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  I do not have access to your personal information, including your name. I am a large language model, trained by Google.
3.6 How are the events stored in the Database?
Since we are using a sqlite DB to store information, let's have a quick peek to see how information is stored.

import sqlite3

def check_data_in_db():
    with sqlite3.connect("my_agent_data.db") as connection:
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        result = cursor.execute(
            "select app_name, session_id, author, content from events"
        )
        print([_[0] for _ in result.description])
        for each in result.fetchall():
            print(each)


check_data_in_db()
['app_name', 'session_id', 'author', 'content']
('default', 'test-db-session-01', 'user', '{"parts": [{"text": "Hi, I am Sam! What is the capital of the United States?"}], "role": "user"}')
('default', 'test-db-session-01', 'text_chat_bot', '{"parts": [{"text": "Hi Sam! The capital of the United States is Washington, D.C."}], "role": "model"}')
('default', 'test-db-session-01', 'user', '{"parts": [{"text": "Hello! What is my name?"}], "role": "user"}')
('default', 'test-db-session-01', 'text_chat_bot', '{"parts": [{"text": "Your name is Sam."}], "role": "model"}')
('default', 'test-db-session-01', 'user', '{"parts": [{"text": "What is the capital of India?"}], "role": "user"}')
('default', 'test-db-session-01', 'text_chat_bot', '{"parts": [{"text": "The capital of India is New Delhi."}], "role": "model"}')
('default', 'test-db-session-01', 'user', '{"parts": [{"text": "Hello! What is my name?"}], "role": "user"}')
('default', 'test-db-session-01', 'text_chat_bot', '{"parts": [{"text": "Your name is Sam."}], "role": "model"}')
('default', 'test-db-session-02', 'user', '{"parts": [{"text": "Hello! What is my name?"}], "role": "user"}')
('default', 'test-db-session-02', 'text_chat_bot', '{"parts": [{"text": "I do not have access to your personal information, including your name. I am a large language model, trained by Google."}], "role": "model"}')
⏳ Section 4: Context Compaction
As you can see, all the events are stored in full in the session Database, and this quickly adds up. For a long, complex task, this list of events can become very large, leading to slower performance and higher costs.

But what if we could automatically summarize the past? Let's use ADK's Context Compaction feature to see how to automatically reduce the context that's stored in the Session.

Context compaction

4.1 Create an App for the agent
To enable this feature, let's use the same chatbot_agent we created in Section 3.2.

The first step is to create an object called App. We'll give it a name and pass in our chatbot_agent.

We'll also create a new config to do the Context Compaction. This EventsCompactionConfig defines two key variables:

compaction_interval: Asks the Runner to compact the history after every n conversations
overlap_size: Defines the number of previous conversations to retain for overlap
We'll then provide this app to the Runner.

# Re-define our app with Events Compaction enabled
research_app_compacting = App(
    name="research_app_compacting",
    root_agent=chatbot_agent,
    # This is the new part!
    events_compaction_config=EventsCompactionConfig(
        compaction_interval=3,  # Trigger compaction every 3 invocations
        overlap_size=1,  # Keep 1 previous turn for context
    ),
)

db_url = "sqlite:///my_agent_data.db"  # Local SQLite file
session_service = DatabaseSessionService(db_url=db_url)

# Create a new runner for our upgraded app
research_runner_compacting = Runner(
    app=research_app_compacting, session_service=session_service
)


print("✅ Research App upgraded with Events Compaction!")
✅ Research App upgraded with Events Compaction!
/tmp/ipykernel_48/3773147741.py:6: UserWarning: [EXPERIMENTAL] EventsCompactionConfig: This feature is experimental and may change or be removed in future versions without notice. It may introduce breaking changes at any time.
  events_compaction_config=EventsCompactionConfig(
4.2 Running the Demo
Now, let's have a conversation that is long enough to trigger the compaction. When you run the cell below, the output will look like a normal conversation. However, because we configured our App, a compaction process will run silently in the background after the 3rd invocation.

In the next step, we'll prove that it happened.

# Turn 1
await run_session(
    research_runner_compacting,
    "What is the latest news about AI in healthcare?",
    "compaction_demo",
)

# Turn 2
await run_session(
    research_runner_compacting,
    "Are there any new developments in drug discovery?",
    "compaction_demo",
)

# Turn 3 - Compaction should trigger after this turn!
await run_session(
    research_runner_compacting,
    "Tell me more about the second development you found.",
    "compaction_demo",
)

# Turn 4
await run_session(
    research_runner_compacting,
    "Who are the main companies involved in that?",
    "compaction_demo",
)

*   **Predicting Target "Druggability":** AI models can assess whether a newly identified target is likely to be successfully modulated by a drug, saving resources on targets that are unlikely to yield a therapeutic.

**3. Predicting Drug Efficacy and Toxicity with Higher Accuracy:**

*   **"Digital Twins" and Simulation:** Advanced AI models can create more sophisticated in-vitro and in-vivo simulations of how a drug will behave in the human body, predicting its effectiveness and potential side effects with greater precision.
*   **Reducing Preclinical Failure Rates:** By better predicting failures early on, AI helps reduce the costly attrition rates in preclinical drug development.

**4. Repurposing Existing Drugs:**

*   **Finding New Uses:** AI can analyze the known properties of approved drugs and identify potential new therapeutic applications for diseases they weren't originally intended for. This is a faster and often cheaper route to new treatments.
*   **Example:** During the COVID-19 pandemic, AI played a role in identifying existing drugs that showed promise against the virus.

**5. Optimizing Clinical Trial Design and Patient Selection:**

*   **Stratifying Patients:** AI can analyze patient data to identify subgroups that are most likely to respond to a particular drug. This leads to more efficient and successful clinical trials.
*   **Predicting Trial Outcomes:** AI models can help predict the likelihood of success for a clinical trial based on various factors, allowing for better resource allocation.

**6. AI for Antibody and Protein Design:**

*   **Tailored Biologics:** AI is increasingly used to design novel antibodies and therapeutic proteins with specific binding properties and enhanced stability. This is crucial for developing treatments for complex diseases like autoimmune disorders and cancer.

**Key Companies and Trends to Watch:**

*   **AI-Native Biotech Companies:** A surge of startups are being built entirely around AI-driven drug discovery platforms. Examples include **Insilico Medicine, Recursion Pharmaceuticals, Exscientia, Atomwise, and Schrödinger.**
*   **Big Pharma Partnerships:** Established pharmaceutical companies are heavily investing in AI, either by building their own capabilities or forging strategic partnerships with AI-focused biotech firms.
*   **Focus on Specific Diseases:** While AI can be applied broadly, there's a growing trend of companies focusing AI expertise on specific disease areas like oncology, neurodegenerative diseases, and infectious diseases.

**Challenges Remain:**

Despite the rapid progress, challenges persist:

*   **Data Quality and Access:** The effectiveness of AI heavily relies on high-quality, diverse, and well-annotated data, which can be a bottleneck.
*   **Interpretability (Explainable AI):** Understanding *why* an AI model proposes a specific molecule or target is crucial for scientific validation and regulatory approval.
*   **Integration with Wet Lab Experiments:** AI insights need to be rigorously validated through traditional laboratory experiments.
*   **Regulatory Acceptance:** Regulatory bodies are still developing frameworks for evaluating AI-generated drug candidates.

In summary, AI is not just a tool in drug discovery; it's fundamentally changing the paradigm, enabling faster, more efficient, and more innovative approaches to finding new medicines. The pace of innovation in this area is breathtaking.

 ### Session: compaction_demo

User > Tell me more about the second development you found.
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  You're likely referring to the **second development I mentioned in the context of drug discovery, which is "Accelerated Target Identification and Validation."**

This is a truly transformative area where AI is making a profound impact. Let me elaborate:

**The Traditional Challenge of Target Identification:**

For decades, identifying and validating a biological target (a specific molecule in the body, like a protein or gene, that a drug can interact with to produce a therapeutic effect) has been a slow, laborious, and often serendipitous process. Researchers would:

*   **Hypothesize based on existing knowledge:** Start with what was already understood about a disease.
*   **Conduct extensive experiments:** Perform countless lab tests, genetic studies, and biochemical assays.
*   **Face high failure rates:** Many identified targets turned out to be not as crucial as initially thought, or not "druggable" (meaning a molecule couldn't effectively bind to it).

**How AI is Revolutionizing Target Identification and Validation:**

AI, particularly machine learning and deep learning, excels at processing and finding patterns in massive, complex datasets that are far beyond human capacity. Here's how it's changing the game:

1.  **Unprecedented Data Integration and Analysis:**
    *   **Multi-omics Data:** AI can simultaneously analyze data from genomics (DNA), transcriptomics (RNA), proteomics (proteins), metabolomics (metabolites), and more. This holistic view reveals intricate biological pathways and disease mechanisms that are impossible to discern from a single data type.
    *   **Real-World Evidence (RWE):** AI can sift through electronic health records (EHRs), patient registries, and claims data to identify correlations between biological factors and disease outcomes.
    *   **Literature Mining:** Natural Language Processing (NLP) AI can scan millions of scientific papers, patents, and clinical trial reports to extract relevant information, identify emerging trends, and connect seemingly unrelated research findings.

2.  **Identifying Novel Disease Drivers:**
    *   **Uncovering Hidden Relationships:** AI algorithms can detect subtle, non-obvious correlations between genes, proteins, and disease states that human researchers might miss. This can lead to the identification of entirely new therapeutic targets previously unknown.
    *   **Network Biology:** AI models can map complex biological networks, highlighting key nodes (potential targets) whose manipulation could have a significant impact on disease progression.

3.  **Predicting "Druggability":**
    *   **Assessing Target Suitability:** Not all biological targets are good candidates for drug development. AI models can be trained to predict:
        *   **Binding Affinity:** How well a potential drug molecule can bind to the target.
        *   **Modulation Potential:** Whether binding to the target will lead to the desired therapeutic effect (e.g., inhibiting an enzyme, activating a receptor).
        *   **Off-Target Effects:** The likelihood of the drug interacting with other unintended targets, which can lead to side effects.
    *   **Prioritizing Promising Targets:** This predictive capability allows researchers to focus their efforts and resources on targets that have a higher probability of success, significantly reducing wasted time and money.

4.  **Accelerated Hypothesis Generation and Testing:**
    *   **Faster Insights:** AI can generate hypotheses about potential targets much faster than traditional methods.
    *   **Guiding Experimental Design:** The insights from AI can inform and optimize the design of subsequent laboratory experiments, making the validation process more efficient.

**Examples and Impact:**

*   **Identifying new cancer targets:** AI is helping to pinpoint specific genetic mutations or protein expressions that drive cancer growth, leading to the development of targeted therapies.
*   **Discovering targets for neurodegenerative diseases:** By analyzing complex brain imaging and genetic data, AI is helping to uncover targets for Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and other debilitating conditions.
*   **Finding novel targets for rare diseases:** For diseases with limited understanding, AI can analyze sparse data to uncover potential targets that would be nearly impossible to find otherwise.

**In essence, AI acts as an incredibly powerful microscope and detective for biology.** It allows us to see and connect pieces of the biological puzzle that were previously invisible or too complex to assemble, thereby accelerating the identification and validation of the most promising targets for new drugs.

4.3 Verifying Compaction in the Session History
The conversation above looks normal, but the history has been changed behind the scenes. How can we prove it?

We can inspect the events list from our session. The compaction process doesn't delete old events; it replaces them with a single, new Event that contains the summary. Let's find it.

# Get the final session state
final_session = await session_service.get_session(
    app_name=research_runner_compacting.app_name,
    user_id=USER_ID,
    session_id="compaction_demo",
)

print("--- Searching for Compaction Summary Event ---")
found_summary = False
for event in final_session.events:
    # Compaction events have a 'compaction' attribute
    if event.actions and event.actions.compaction:
        print("\n✅ SUCCESS! Found the Compaction Event:")
        print(f"  Author: {event.author}")
        print(f"\n Compacted information: {event}")
        found_summary = True
        break

if not found_summary:
    print(
        "\n❌ No compaction event found. Try increasing the number of turns in the demo."
    )
--- Searching for Compaction Summary Event ---

✅ SUCCESS! Found the Compaction Event:

4.4 What you've accomplished: Automatic Context Management
You just found the proof! The presence of that special summary Event in your session's history is the tangible result of the compaction process.

Let's recap what you just witnessed:

Silent Operation: You ran a standard conversation, and from the outside, nothing seemed different.
Background Compaction: Because you configured the App with EventsCompactionConfig, the ADK Runner automatically monitored the conversation length. Once the threshold was met, it triggered the summarization process in the background.
Verified Result: By inspecting the session's events, you found the summary that the LLM generated. This summary now replaces the older, more verbose turns in the agent's active context.
For all future turns in this conversation, the agent will be given this concise summary instead of the full history. This saves costs, improves performance, and helps the agent stay focused on what's most important.

4.5 More Context Engineering options in ADK
👉 Custom Compaction
In this example, we used ADK's default summarizer. For more advanced use cases, you can provide your own by defining a custom SlidingWindowCompactor and passing it to the config. This allows you to control the summarization prompt or even use a different, specialized LLM for the task. You can read more about it in the official documentation.

👉 Context Caching
ADK also provides Context Caching to help reduce the token size of the static instructions that are fed to the LLM by caching the request data. Read more about it here.

The Problem
While we can do Context Compaction and use a database to resume a session, we face new challenges now. In some cases, we have key information or preferences that we want to share across other sessions.

In these scenarios, instead of sharing the entire session history, transferring information from a few key variables can improve the session experience. Let's see how to do it!

🤝 Section 5: Working with Session State
5.1 Creating custom tools for Session state management
Let's explore how to manually manage session state through custom tools. In this example, we'll identify a transferable characteristic, like a user's name and their country, and create tools to capture and save it.

Why This Example?

The username is a perfect example of information that:

Is introduced once but referenced multiple times
Should persist throughout a conversation
Represents a user-specific characteristic that enhances personalization
Here, for demo purposes, we'll create two tools that can store and retrieve user name and country from the Session State. Note that all tools have access to the ToolContext object. You don't have to create separate tools for each piece of information you want to share.

# Define scope levels for state keys (following best practices)
USER_NAME_SCOPE_LEVELS = ("temp", "user", "app")


# This demonstrates how tools can write to session state using tool_context.
# The 'user:' prefix indicates this is user-specific data.
def save_userinfo(
    tool_context: ToolContext, user_name: str, country: str
) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Tool to record and save user name and country in session state.

    Args:
        user_name: The username to store in session state
        country: The name of the user's country
    """
    # Write to session state using the 'user:' prefix for user data
    tool_context.state["user:name"] = user_name
    tool_context.state["user:country"] = country

    return {"status": "success"}


# This demonstrates how tools can read from session state.
def retrieve_userinfo(tool_context: ToolContext) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Tool to retrieve user name and country from session state.
    """
    # Read from session state
    user_name = tool_context.state.get("user:name", "Username not found")
    country = tool_context.state.get("user:country", "Country not found")

    return {"status": "success", "user_name": user_name, "country": country}


print("✅ Tools created.")
✅ Tools created.
Key Concepts:

Tools can access tool_context.state to read/write session state
Use descriptive key prefixes (user:, app:, temp:) for organization
State persists across conversation turns within the same session
5.2 Creating an Agent with Session State Tools
Now let's create a new agent that has access to our session state management tools:

# Configuration
APP_NAME = "default"
USER_ID = "default"
MODEL_NAME = "gemini-2.5-flash-lite"

# Create an agent with session state tools
root_agent = LlmAgent(
    model=Gemini(model="gemini-2.5-flash-lite", retry_options=retry_config),
    name="text_chat_bot",
    description="""A text chatbot.
    Tools for managing user context:
    * To record username and country when provided use `save_userinfo` tool. 
    * To fetch username and country when required use `retrieve_userinfo` tool.
    """,
    tools=[save_userinfo, retrieve_userinfo],  # Provide the tools to the agent
)

# Set up session service and runner
session_service = InMemorySessionService()
runner = Runner(agent=root_agent, session_service=session_service, app_name="default")

print("✅ Agent with session state tools initialized!")
✅ Agent with session state tools initialized!
5.3 Testing Session State in Action
Let's test how the agent uses session state to remember information across conversation turns:

# Test conversation demonstrating session state
await run_session(
    runner,
    [
        "Hi there, how are you doing today? What is my name?",  # Agent shouldn't know the name yet
        "My name is Sam. I'm from Poland.",  # Provide name - agent should save it
        "What is my name? Which country am I from?",  # Agent should recall from session state
    ],
    "state-demo-session",
)
 ### Session: state-demo-session

User > Hi there, how are you doing today? What is my name?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Hello! I'm doing great. I can't tell you your name just yet, as I haven't been told what it is. Can you please tell me your name and your country? That way, I can remember it for you.

User > My name is Sam. I'm from Poland.
WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts. Check the full candidates.content.parts accessor to get the full model response.
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  It's nice to meet you, Sam! I've saved that you're from Poland. What else can I help you with today?

User > What is my name? Which country am I from?
WARNING:google_genai.types:Warning: there are non-text parts in the response: ['function_call'], returning concatenated text result from text parts. Check the full candidates.content.parts accessor to get the full model response.
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Your name is Sam and you are from Poland.
5.4 Inspecting Session State
Let's directly inspect the session state to see what's stored:

# Retrieve the session and inspect its state
session = await session_service.get_session(
    app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id="state-demo-session"
)

print("Session State Contents:")
print(session.state)
print("\n🔍 Notice the 'user:name' and 'user:country' keys storing our data!")
Session State Contents:
{'user:name': 'Sam', 'user:country': 'Poland'}

🔍 Notice the 'user:name' and 'user:country' keys storing our data!
5.5 Session State Isolation
As we've already seen, an important characteristic of session state is that it's isolated per session. Let's demonstrate this by starting a new session:

# Start a completely new session - the agent won't know our name
await run_session(
    runner,
    ["Hi there, how are you doing today? What is my name?"],
    "new-isolated-session",
)

# Expected: The agent won't know the name because this is a different session
 ### Session: new-isolated-session

User > Hi there, how are you doing today? What is my name?
gemini-2.5-flash-lite >  Hello! I'm doing great, thank you for asking. I don't have access to your name yet. If you'd like to tell me, I can remember it for you! 

5.6 Cross-Session State Sharing
While sessions are isolated by default, you might notice something interesting. Let's check the state of our new session (new-isolated-session):

# Check the state of the new session
session = await session_service.get_session(
    app_name=APP_NAME, user_id=USER_ID, session_id="new-isolated-session"
)

print("New Session State:")
print(session.state)

# Note: Depending on implementation, you might see shared state here.
# This is where the distinction between session-specific and user-specific state becomes important.
New Session State:
{'user:name': 'Sam', 'user:country': 'Poland'}
🧹 Cleanup
# Clean up any existing database to start fresh (if Notebook is restarted)
import os

if os.path.exists("my_agent_data.db"):
    os.remove("my_agent_data.db")
print("✅ Cleaned up old database files")
✅ Cleaned up old database files
